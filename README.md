# SimuDine â€” Inter-Process Communication System

This project simulates a restaurant environment using **System V Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** in C.  
It models different restaurant roles â€” cook, waiter, and customer â€” and coordinates them using shared memory, semaphores, and message queues.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Cook process**: Prepares food items and updates shared memory.
- **Waiter process**: Serves customers and handles order communication.
- **Customer process**: Places orders and interacts with the system.
- **Restaurant manager**: Coordinates multiple processes to ensure smooth operation.
- **System V IPC**: Demonstrates shared memory usage, semaphores for synchronization, and inter-process messaging.
